# Spark-Incremental-Load-Project
This repository demonstrates a PySpark ETL pipeline that performs incremental data loads, updating only new or changed records from source to target. It handles late-arriving data, prevents duplicates, and writes optimized output to Parquet, Hive, or Delta Lake, providing a scalable solution for production-ready data pipelines.
